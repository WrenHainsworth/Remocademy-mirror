                            <p style="font-weight: lighter; font-size: 16px">In 2020 March, schools all around the world started shutting down,
                                forcing them to move to online learning platforms, or worse, have no education because  schools
                                wasn't prepared for providing education remotely. Although schools in some countries such has China, US already used
                                some form of online platforms for learning, other countries with low technology adoption rates in education suffered from
                                this pandemic. Japan was one of the countries was affected hugely by the pandemic. Japan is the home country of the founder/developer of this project, and
                                he saw a significant vulnerability in Japanese education system and lack of appropriate education-specific online learning platform.
                                We started this project to provide the world with an education tool that is easy to use for everyone, from young children to old teachers who may be unfamiliar with technology.

                            <h2 class="title" style="margin-top:5%">Goal of this project</h2>
                            <p style="font-weight: lighter; font-size: 16px">One of the problem Japan had with their remote learning is that old teachers and young children found it difficult and tedious to setup and deal with
                                technology devices and platforms.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-weight: lighter; font-size: 16px">
                                The goal of this project is to make an easy to use platform that can be used by people all around the world at all age groups. The platform will cover everything from student's homework management to real-time remote learning system, and the reason
                                for this rather ambitious claim is because students get frustrated when school uses multiple platforms discouraging them to do work.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-weight: lighter; font-size: 16px">How do we know this? It's because our team constitutes of students, who has experienced both the good and the bad about the existing online learning platform. We strive to provide you the best tool for education that meets all the student's needs, teacher's needs, and even the parent's needs.
